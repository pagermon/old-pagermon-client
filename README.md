# PagerMon-Client

Client component of the PagerMon server.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)
* [rtl_fm](https://github.com/osmocom/rtl-sdr)
* or [keenard's fork of rtl_fm](https://github.com/keenerd/rtl-sdr)
* [multimon-ng](https://github.com/EliasOenal/multimon-ng)

### Installing

```
cd client
npm install
cp config/default.json config/config.json
```

Edit config/config.json to suit your environment. Identifier should be a small string that will show up in the 'source' column of the messages display.

Some environments send additional information via the "Function Code" in the pager message. Change `sendFunctionCode` to `true` to send this appended to the end of the address of each message. E.g. `POCSAG512: Address: 1000022  Function: 3  Alpha: test` would land on the server with an address of `10000223`.

Check the samples dir for example usage.
